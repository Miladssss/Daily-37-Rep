## ðŸ›  What is DePIN?
**DePIN** stands for **Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks**.  
Itâ€™s a category of blockchain projects that incentivize people to build and operate physical infrastructure (like hotspots, sensors, or storage) in a decentralized way.  

Examples:
- ðŸ“¡ Wireless networks (Helium, Pollen, WiFiMap)  
- âš¡ Energy grids (Power Ledger, Energy Web)  
- ðŸ“¦ Storage networks (Filecoin, Arweave)  
- ðŸš— Mobility & mapping (Hivemapper, DIMO)
